# Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4, setting swappiness to 0 will even more
# aggressively avoid swapping out which increases the risk of out-of-memory (OOM)
# killing under strong memory and I/O pressure. To achieve the same behavior of
# swappiness as previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 in which the
# recommendation was to set swappiness to 0, set swappiness to the value between
# 1 and 20. The recommendation of swappiness for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 or
# higher running Oracle databases is now a value between 1-20.

# Dirty data is data that has been modified and held in the page cache for

# SHMMAX – is the maximum size in bytes of a single shared memory segment
# Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 and above, SHMMAX default value is set to
# 18446744073692774399 bytes, equivalent to roughly 18 petabytes. Due to this, there is no need to
# calculate SHMMAX because of the very large size already provided. It is recommended to use the value
# set in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 and above because the value is purposely set higher than the
# architectural memory limits to ensure that any Oracle SGA value set within an Oracle database
# instance may fit in one single shared memory segment.
# The following parameters have been removed as the default value is equal or higher
# than the suggested recommendation by Oracle.
#kernel.shmmax = 4398046511104

# SHMALL – is the maximum total amount of shared memory pages
# Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 and above, SHMALL default value is

# The following parameters have been removed as the default value is equal or higher
# than the suggested recommendation by Oracle.

# SHMMNI – is the maximum total amount of shared memory segments
# SHMMNI is the maximum total amount of shared memory segments. A default installation of Red Hat
# Enterprise Linux 7 x86_64 provides a SHMMNI default value of 4096. By Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
# optimizing the SHMMAX value with one shared memory segment per Oracle SGA, this parameter
# reflects the maximum number of Oracle and ASM instances that can be started on a system. Oracle
# recommends the value of SHMMNI to be left at the default value of 4096.
# The following parameters have been removed as the default value is equal or higher
# than the suggested recommendation by Oracle.

# SEMMSL – is defined as the maximum number of semaphores per semaphore set
# SEMMNI – is defined as the maximum number of semaphore sets for the entire system

# The kernel parameter FS.FILE-MAX sets the maximum number of open file handles assigned to the Red
# Hat Enterprise Linux 7 operating system. Oracle recommends that for each Oracle RAC database
# instance found within a system, allocate 512*PROCESSSES in addition to the open file handles already
# assigned to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 operating system.
# While the value of the FS.FILE-MAX parameter varies upon every environment, this reference
# environment uses the default value within Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 (9784283).
